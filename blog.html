        <h1>The Silly 3D Model: Day 3</h1>
        <p>15/12/2023 - 3pm</p>
        <p>
            Following some fixes with the model and ajusting the UV map to the model I can now start painting textures,
            I have gone for a 500x500 canvas size to give the silly's Texture a pixelated style.
            This was problematic to begin with because the texture would keep blurring whenever I applyed it.
            However following setting the rendering tab (A tab i didn't even know existed) to some settings
            I copyed from <a href="https://youtu.be/JmFvge8idzo?t=828" target="_blank">This Youtube Video</a> It appears to display
            the texture correctly. Now its time to just paint the texture. Blenders Texture Paint Tab kinda sucks and keeps
            drawing my face textures off center. It also lacks the proper brushes so I have decided to do the texturing
            in clipstudio paint, which has all the brushes I need :D
            <br>
            Its hair still needs to be fixed a little but I can work on that when i start doing the hair texture! Probably
            A bad workflow but I'm doing this for fun I dont care

            Currently I am learning to create this 3D model for the website!. This will be a 3D mascot for the website! I don't achualy know how to 3D model so it has taken me hours to make minimal progress. But I think im starting to get over the learning curve! 
            <br><br> These drawings purposly look kinda bad to make it easier to 3D model the creature.
